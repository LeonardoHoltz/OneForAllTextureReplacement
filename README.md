# OneForAllTextureReplacement
Python script that executes texture replacements over all textures in a file. It can be used during a texture dump for real time results or be used after a full texture dump.

For now it doesn't adjusts the target texture size to the original textures sizes. It just generates make copies of the target texture and rename them with the original textures file name.

Tested with the following emulators:
